						Basement renovation is one of the most popular ways to increase living space while keeping home renovation expenditures to a minimum. Basement finishing utilizes space that is already there; for family rooms, hobby rooms, play rooms, media centers, 
						music rooms, exercise areas, office space, or additional bedrooms. Build off of our knowledge, start customizing a <strong>finsished basement</strong> as unique as your home.

				<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">Older Home<strong>Basement Renovation</strong> </h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					If you have an older home and your basement doesn't have enough head room or has a dirt floor, it is still possible to renovate the basement of your dreams.  Until recently, overcoming this obstacle by digging the basement deeper was not feasible. 
					However, new innovation and technology has made this a viable solution. Because many older homes were built on a foundation with a dirt floor basement, old house renovation projects might include pouring a basement floor. Older homes that already have 
					basement floor concrete often need it replaced, due to heaving, cracking, or crumbling concrete. Most building codes require a minimum of 7 ½ feet from floor to ceiling for habitable rooms, 7 feet for halls and bathrooms, and 7 feet (with restrictions) 
					for obstructions such as pipes or beams. A common scenario is an older home with a dirt basement floor, and inadequate headroom for a basement renovation project

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					<img src="img/roof-inspection.gif" alt="roof inspection" width="290" height="300" border="0"align="right">In the one-wall kitchen remodel, all major work zones of the kitchen are arrayed along one wall. Major work zones include the refrigerator, sink, and stove/oven. Minor work zones would include: 
					microwave, trash compactor, dishwater, etc. Advantages of the one-wall <strong>kitchen remodel</strong> are less expensive, compact design and a good work flow.  Limited counter space means cheaper costs, as counters 
					tend to run up <strong>kitchen renovation</strong>budgets considerably. A one-wall is the best way to create space in the rest of your <strong>kitchen</strong>, if needed for a table or other uses and you keep all of your major cooking functions 
					within a few feet of each other. Disadvantages of the one-wall <strong>kitchen remodel</strong> is the resale values are lower for minimal <strong>kitchens</strong> simply because homebuyers place such a high premium on the <strong>kitchen</strong> nowadays. 
					Almost every year, <strong>kitchens</strong> get more lavish, making it impossible for the one wall design to keep up. Simply put, homeowners demand more.
					</p>
					<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">Corridor Style <strong>Kitchen Remodel</strong></h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					The best <strong>kitchen contractor designs</strong> tend to center around functionality, a corridor-style <strong>kitchen remodel</strong> is very popular for its ease of use. There are two types of corridor-style <strong>kitchen remodels</strong>, walls on both sides and kitchen island or peninsula. When you have a wall on one side and an open space (like a living room) on the other side, you have a <strong>kitchen</strong> peninsula design. On the open side, a <strong>kitchen</strong> island or peninsula of cabinets and countertop forms a wall between the <strong>kitchen</strong> and the open space. The corridor-style <strong>kitchen</strong> design optimizes <strong>kitchen</strong> workflow and saves space, but it does have its limitations.
					 The corridor-style <strong>kitchen design</strong> is often one not of choice but of circumstances: you have a small space to work with. But many homeowners also do choose the corridor-style kitchen simply because they think it best suits their needs. The corridor style <strong>kitchen</strong>, saves space, minimizes use of expensive countertops, clusters the services (water, electrical, etc.) together, promotes effective <strong>kitchen</strong> triangle design, and saves you money. The corridor style <strong>kitchen</strong> design is highly functional because it uses the classic <strong>kitchen</strong> triangle. This layout gives a bit more space for counters and cabinets, though crowding between the two main work spaces may be a problem. Still, the corridor-style <strong>kitchen design</strong> is a highly affordable and functional plan.</p>
					
					<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">The L-shape and Double L-shape <strong>Kitchen Remodel</strong></h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					Along with the corridor plan, the L-shaped <strong>kitchen design</strong> plan is very popular, though this plan does away with the crowding problems found in the corridor plan. We still find the <strong>kitchen</strong> triangle, though the walk from range to refrigerator is longer. This arrangement allows as much--and even a bit more--counter and cabinet space than the L-shaped design. Note that with the increased counter space, a double-sink can be installed. 

A highly evolved <strong>kitchen renovation</strong> layout, the double-L allows for two workstations. The smaller "L" has a cooktop (but not an oven) and a second sink. The major cooking operations are focused on this area, while food prep goes on in the larger of the "L" spaces. This larger "L" also has tons of open counter space because the cooktop has been moved away. Note that not much space is gained for cabinets: the smaller "L" has only a short run along the wall for 
cabinets (though cabinets can be hung off the ceiling above the cooktop, if desired).

<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">U-Shape <strong>Kitchen Contractor Remodel</strong></h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					The U-shape <strong>kitchen contractor remodel</strong> plan can be thought of as a corridor-shape plan--but with a closed end. The closed end gives extra room for a range or a sink. This arrangement maintains good workflow by means of the classic <strong>kitchen</strong> triangle. The closed end also provides plenty of space for extra cabinets. With an efficient working triangle a U-shaped <strong>kitchen</strong> provides the ideal layout to your <strong>kitchen</strong>. The spaces between the three elements are 
					properly divided to increase the use of space for cooking and storage. Two people can work together without interfering with each other as plenty of work space is available with the U-shaped kitchen.
