	Benefits of high performance, energy saving custom-made <strong>replacement windows</strong>
	</h3>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Replacement windows</strong> in the United States are costing consumers approximately $35 billion a year in energy loss. The next generation of <strong>new replacement windows</strong> can cut energy loss in half. Many of today's high-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> are three to four times more energy-efficient than <strong>windows</strong> commonly installed 10 years ago. <strong>Replacement windows</strong> comprise 10-25% of the exterior wall area of new homes. 
	According to recent studies <strong>replacement windows</strong> account for up to 25% of a typical house's heating load  and account for up to 50% of a typical house's cooling load in cooling-dominated climates. Advances in technology such as increases in R-value, decreases in U-Value, Low-emittance (low-E) coatings, <strong>Double-glazed replacement windows</strong>, Argon  Gas filled <strong>replacement windows</strong> and welded <strong>replacement window</strong> frames have decreased energy bills by as much as 40%!
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	We supply a variety of <strong>custom replacement windows</strong> to fit any need. Manufacturer's recommend <strong>custom windows</strong> because they are made to fit exactly in existing openings.  This means there are no spaces to fill in and the viewing area is maximized. All our <strong>replacement windows</strong> our energy star approved, but be careful. Just because a window is energy star approved does not mean it is eligible for tax rebates. A majority of stock windows are not eligible for the 2009 tax rebates.

	Why <strong>Custom Vinly Replacement Windows</strong> From J.M. Grove are the <strong>Best Windows</strong>
	</h3>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Vinyl replacement windows</strong> lower utility bills. High-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> are better insulated and more air-tight. These features reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling which results in lower utility bills, making a <strong>windows home</strong> less expensive to operate. In insulated vinyl frames, the hollow cavities of the frame are filled with insulation making them thermally superior to standard vinyl and wood frames offered by most Clementon
, NJ dealers.

	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<img src="../img/ladywindow.gif" alt="replacement windows" width="165" height="134" border="0" align="left"><strong>Vinyl replacement windows</strong> are high quality. High-performance <strong>windows</strong> are often constructed with better quality materials that can result in stronger, easier to operate, and longer lasting <strong>windows</strong>.  As a result of these manufacturers frequently offer extended warranties improvements on these products. <strong>Vinyl window</strong> frames do not require painting and have good moisture resistance. Because the color goes all the way through, there is no finish coat that can be damaged or deteriorate over time -- the surface is therefore maintenance-free.

 Nj Replacement windows" width="323" height="218" border="0"align="right">Reduced obsolescence.  Based on recent trends for improved efficiency, high-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> are expected to become standard practice for the building industry. Since it is both difficult and costly to <strong>replace windows</strong> after a house is built, it is best to install high-performance products during the original construction. ENERGY STAR labeled Clementon
 homes constructed with high-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> are, therefore, expected to be less vulnerable to obsolescence. 
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
		Improved comfort. High-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> reduce conductive heat losses and gains resulting in warmer interior surfaces during the winter and cooler interior surfaces during the summer. In <strong>home windows</strong>, approximately 40 percent of our physical comfort is due to the radiant heat exchange between our bodies and the surrounding interior surfaces. Thus, high-performance <strong>replacement windows</strong> improve comfort by reducing this radiant heat exchange. In addition, improved frames reduce drafts and provide more consistent temperatures throughout the house.</li> 
		Improved indoor air quality. High-performance <strong>windows</strong> often have air tightness ratings of 0.2 cfm/ft or less which reduce the amount of unconditioned air leakage into a house. This air leakage can bring in dirt, dust, and other impurities that can negatively affect indoor air quality. </li>

	A windows R-value (installation)- A measure of thermal resistance used to compute the heat lost through your <strong> Clementon
 Nj vinyl replacement window</strong>. The larger  the number, the better the building insulation's effectiveness. Window Insulation should be purchased based on its R value and its U- value. Speak to a representative to learn more about air infiltration and other <strong>window install services</strong> in the Clementon
 NJ area.
	</p>
	
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	A windows U-Value(window install)- A measure of air-to-heat transmission (loss or gain) due to the thermal conductance and the difference in indoor and outdoor temperatures. The lower the U-value, the greater a <strong>window's</strong> resistance to heat flow and the better its insulating value.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	Low-E coating - A microscopically thin metal or metallic oxide coating that is applied to the glass by the manufacturer. It helps keep heat and ultraviolet rays from passing through the <strong>replacement window.</strong>  Virtually invisible, low-E coatings will keep the <strong>window house</strong> warmer in winter by reducing heat loss and cooler in summer by blocking heat from the sun.

	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	Double-glazed <strong>vinyl replacement windows</strong> have a sealed space between two panes of glass to provide an added layer of insulation. Compared with a single pane, double-glazing can cut heat loss nearly in half.  There are also triple-glazed <strong>replacement windows</strong>, which have an even higher insulating value, but also add weight and cost of the windows.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	Argon filled gas <strong>windows</strong>- The gas in the gap between the panes affects the <strong>window's</strong> insulating value. Plain air works and is standard in some <strong>replacement windows,</strong> but many recommend a heavier gas such as argon, which makes <strong>replacement windows</strong> more energy efficient because it's better than air at reducing heat transfer between the inside and the outside of the <strong>window home</strong>.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Replacement windows</strong> with Welded frames- Most dealers recommend frames that are welded over those that are mechanically fastened or screwed together. Also look for neat, well-bonded joints at the corners of the frame.
