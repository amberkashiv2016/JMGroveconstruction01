					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
Before you start selecting tiles, sanitaryware and fittings, it is important to spend time assessing all of your requirements. Make a list of the things you like about your current <strong>bathroom</strong> and the things you would like to change. Visit our showrooms and look through books and magazines for inspiration. Think about a friend�s bathroom that you like or the bathroom of a hotel that you have stayed in � what features appeal to you most?


Is your bathroom big enough? If not, is there any way you can extend it or move it to another room? If you have a large household do you require an additional cloakroom or shower room to ease congestion in the morning?

 Are you happy with the current layout of the space or would you prefer to re-arrange the sanitaryware? Would you like to include a bath and a shower to your <strong>bathroom remodel</strong>, and is there enough space to accommodate the two?

Prioritising your needs and desires will give you food for thought and a point from where to start. Every household is different, so don�t be led by what�s in fashion. A well-designed <strong>bathroom remodel</strong> is a perfect balance of function and aesthetics and these are unique to the individual.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">

The age and ability of the users will also affect your <strong>bathroom remodeling</strong> requirements. Safety features such as thermostatic controls for showers and anti-slip finishes on tiles, the bath and shower tray will benefit everyone, but are especially important if the room is to be used by children or the elderly. 


A <strong>new bathroom renovation </strong> is a big investment so choose your colour scheme and fittings wisely. Will you still be enamoured by your purchase in 10 years� time? If you are intending to move home in the near future, will it appeal to potential purchasers? A <strong>bathroom and kitchen remodel</strong> are both major selling points. Natural coloured tiles and white sanitaryware are always a safe option, as they will not date. You can always add a personal touch with brightly coloured towels and accessories.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					<img src="img/bathroom-pic2.jpg" alt="bathroom remodeling company" width="350" height="310" border="0"align="right"> When <strong>remodeling a bathroom</strong> there are essentially two rules: stay within your color scheme and stay within your style.
 					Staying within your color scheme is probably the most important concept to master when designing your <strong>bathroom remodel</strong>. Color is the foundational element that glues the entire room together in a way that is pleasing to the eye, yet makes it unique from all the other <strong>bathroom renovations </strong>in the world.
The question that first time �designers� may be asking is, �How do I choose a color scheme for my <strong>bathroom remodel Blue Bell Pa 19087</strong>?� 
One way to get started is to simply think about the colors that you are naturally drawn to. What colors do you like to wear and reach for in your closet more often than not? Are they the cool colors like blues and greens or more of the warm colors like yellows and oranges?
Your style is very important. It is how you will pick the various fixtures in your <strong>bathroom renovation</strong>, like the cabinetry, mirrors, accessories, and faucets. For instance, if you want to create a victorian style <strong>bathroom remodel</strong>, you would look for pieces with ornate and intricate details, especially in the woodwork and cabinetry. 

Sticking to a style is important because you want to create a feeling of comfort, function, and aesthetics. If you place a modern bathtub with its clean, sparse lines, in a bathroom that has a colonial feel, with the weathered woodwork and fancy wood molding, you would create a sense of style confusion. The bathtub would look out of place and will upset the balance in your design. Speak to a J.M. Grove represenative for more <strong>bathroom remodeling ideas</strong>
