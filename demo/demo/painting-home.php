					In addition to the regular paints we have a myriad of other possible speciality paints that our <strong>painting contractors</strong>
					can offer their expertise on. Here we list the diverse kinds of <strong>painting</strong> possibilities 
					that might get your imagination going.
					
					
					<br><h2>Different Kinds of Paints</h2><br> 
					1. <strong>Latext Paint</strong>
					<br> 
					
					<img src="img/popcorn_paint.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="210" height="230" border="0"align="left">
					
					
					As the name implies, this type of <strong>wood flooring</strong> is <strong>solid wood</strong> all the way through, from top to bottom. 
					It's similar to any other stick of lumber that sawn straight off of the log--no additional materials added. 
					It's usually just called "<strong>hardwood floor.</strong>"
					Hardwood flooring comes either unfinished or prefinished. Unfinished hardwood tends to be a little cheaper than prefinished, 
					but does require immediate light sanding, staining (optional), and sealing after installation. With prefinished, you can walk on it right after installation. With unfinished, you need to limit usage until it has been sealed. After sealing, you will need to wait at least 48 hours for the sealant to dry. Even then, additional coats may be required. With unfinished, the advantage is you can stain it and seal it to your exact specification. With prefinished, the advantage is the quick turnaround time.
					<br><br><br>
					 
					2. <strong>Oil Paint</strong>
					<br>
					<img src= "img/engineered_wood_flooring.jpg" alt="engineered flooring" width="210" height="300" border="0"align="right">
					<strong>Engineered wood flooring</strong> is an exciting alternative to solid hardwood flooring. Engineered flooring basically is a sandwich of finish wood and plywood. The finish wood is what you see and walk on. 
					The plywood underneath comprises 80-90% of the floor. 
					But it's the plywood that distinguishes engineered wood flooring from solid hardwood. Each ply runs perpendicular to its adjacent ply, giving dimensional strength to the sandwich. This means that engineered wood flooring stands up well to areas with light moisture--basements and bathrooms.

					Another great thing about engineered wood is the range of installation options. The thinner varieties can be nailed down; the thicker kinds can be installed as floating floors. Floating floors are the great boon to do-it-yourselfers--no heavy staplers to lug around, no sub-floor. As long as your existing floor is level and stable, you can install the floating floor right on top.

					Engineered wood flooring's greatest weakness is its thin top layer. Remarkably, this 1/16" to 1/8" finish layer can be sanded. But only once or twice. Three is pushing it. In any case, I strongly recommend you seek the advice of a reputable flooring company before sanding. Unlike solid hardwood, deep scratches and dents in engineered wood cannot be sanded out.
					<br><br><br>
					
					3. <strong>Varnish Paint</strong>
					<br>
					<img src= "img/Hardood_Laminate_Flooring.jpg" alt="laminate flooring" width="210" height="230" border="0"align="left">
					Laminate flooring is not real wood, at least not in the way that hardwood and engineered wood are. It's comprised of a thin top layer of resin-infused paper, all on top of a wood-chip composite. 
					Rather, the reason it's included in this article about wood flooring is because it is an amazing simulation of wood. 
					The resin layer is essentially a photograph of wood. You can examine it with a magnifying glass and still be fooled. 
					The other reason it's included here is because most people buy laminate flooring as an alternative to wood flooring.

					Among the advantages of laminate flooring are its scratch-resistence and the fact that it works well in topically moist environments like bathrooms and kitchens (unlike hardwood). And let's not forget: it's laughably easy to install.

					Disadvantages of laminate flooring: hard to walk on (foam underlayment is put down to soften this), it's slippery, and it cannot be sanded.

					4. <strong>Enamel Paint</strong>
					<br><br><br>
					5. <strong>Shelliac Paint</strong>
					<br><br><br>
					6. <strong>Sheen Paint</strong>
