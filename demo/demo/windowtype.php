		<strong>Windows</strong> in the United States are costing consumers approximately $35 billion a year in energy loss. The next generation of <strong>replacement windows</strong> can cut energy loss in half. Many of today's <strong>high-performance windows</strong> are three to four times more <strong>energy-efficient than windows</strong> commonly installed 10 years ago. <strong>Windows</strong> comprise 10-25% of the exterior wall area of new homes. According to recent studies windows account for up to 25% of a typical house's heating load  and account for up to 50% of a typical house's cooling load in cooling-dominated climates. Advances in technology such as increases in R-value, decreases in U-Value, Low-emittance (low-E) coatings, <strong>Double-glazed windows</strong>, <strong>Argon  Gas filled windows</strong> and <strong>welded window frames</strong> have <strong>decreased energy bills</strong> by as much as 40%!

	Benefits of high performance <strong>custom-made replacement windows</strong>
	</h3>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	J.M. Grove supplies a variety of <strong>custom replacement windows</strong> to fit any need. J.M. Grove and our dealers recommend custom-made windows because they are made to fit exactly in existing openings.  This means there are no spaces to fill in and the viewing area is maximized. All our windows our energy star approved, but be careful. Just because a window is energy star approved does not mean it is eligible for tax rebates. A majority of stock windows are not eligible for the 2009 tax rebates.

	<strong>Vinyl replacement windows lower utility bills.</strong> High-performance windows are better insulated and more air-tight. These features reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling which results in lower utility bills, making homes less expensive to operate. In insulated vinyl frames, the hollow cavities of the frame are filled with insulation making them thermally superior to standard vinyl and wood frames.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Vinyl replacement windows are high quality.</strong> High-performance windows are often constructed with better quality materials that can result in stronger, easier to operate, and <strong>longer lasting windows</strong>.  As a result of these manufacturers frequently offer extended warranties improvements on these products. <strong>Vinyl window frames</strong> do not require painting and have good moisture resistance. Because the color goes all the way through, there is no finish coat that can be damaged or deteriorate over time -- the surface is therefore maintenance-free.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Vinyl replacement windows improve resale position.</strong> High-performance windows can provide the many impressive benefits listed above resulting in a more comfortable, quieter, and higher quality home with lower utility bills fewer condensation and fading problems.  These benefits can translate into higher resale value. 
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	Reduced wear on home furnishings. Low-E coatings can block up to 98 percent of the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun.  This radiation causes curtains, <strong>window treatments</strong>, carpeting, and furniture to fade and wear faster. 
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	Reduced obsolescence.  Based on recent trends for improved efficiency, <strong>high-performance windows</strong> are expected to become standard practice for the building industry. Since it is both difficult and costly to replace windows after a house is built, it is best to install high-performance products during the original construction. ENERGY STAR labeled homes constructed with high-performance <strong>windows</strong> are, therefore, expected to be less vulnerable to obsolescence. 
	</p>
	<ul style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 40px;font-size:.8em;">
		<li><strong>Improved comfort. High-performance windows</strong> reduce conductive heat losses and gains resulting in warmer interior surfaces during the winter and cooler interior surfaces during the summer. In homes, approximately 40 percent of our physical comfort is due to the radiant heat exchange between our bodies and the surrounding interior surfaces. Thus, <strong>high-performance windows</strong> improve comfort by reducing this radiant heat exchange. In addition, improved frames reduce drafts and provide more consistent temperatures throughout the house.</li> 
		<li><strong>Improved indoor air quality. High-performance windows</strong> often have air tightness ratings of 0.2 cfm/ft or less which reduce the amount of unconditioned air leakage into a house. This air leakage can bring in dirt, dust, and other impurities that can negatively affect indoor air quality. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">	
	<strong>A windows R-value</strong> (installation)- A measure of thermal resistance used to compute the heat lost through your replacement window. The larger  the number, the better the building insulation's effectiveness. <strong>Window Insulation</strong> should be purchased based on its R value and its U- value. Speak to a representative to learn more about air infiltration.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>A windows U-Value</strong>(installation)- A measure of air-to-heat transmission (loss or gain) due to the thermal conductance and the difference in indoor and outdoor temperatures. The lower the U-value, the greater a <strong>window's resistance to heat flow</strong> and the better its insulating value.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Low-E coating</strong> - A microscopically thin metal or metallic oxide coating that is applied to the glass by the manufacturer. It helps keep heat and ultraviolet rays from passing through the window.  Virtually invisible, low-E coatings will keep the house warmer in winter by reducing heat loss and cooler in summer by blocking heat from the sun.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Double-glazed windows</strong> have a sealed space between two panes of glass to provide an added layer of insulation. Compared with a single pane, double-glazing can cut heat loss nearly in half.  There are also <strong>triple-glazed windows</strong>, which have an even higher insulating value, but also add weight and cost of the windows.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Argon filled gas windows</strong>- The gas in the gap between the panes affects the <strong>window's insulating</strong> value. Plain air works and is standard in some windows, but many recommend a heavier gas such as argon, which makes <strong>windows more energy efficient</strong> because it's better than air at reducing heat transfer between the inside and the outside of the home.
	</p>
	<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
	<strong>Replacement windows</strong> with Welded frames- Most dealers recommend frames that are welded over those that are mechanically fastened or screwed together. Also look for neat, well-bonded joints at the corners of the frame.
