		<h2>Steel Entry Doors</h2>
		<p>
			Smooth and textured professional grade steel doors from ProVia Door provide a durable and energy-efficient addition to your home that will last for years to come. Both the smooth steel doors and textured steel doors are constructed of 20-gauge galvanized steel, which gives you 49% more steel than standard consumer grade 24-gauge steel doors. This exceptional durability is endorsed as "the door preferred by America's top remodelers" and is backed by a lifetime limited transferable warranty.

		<h2>Fiberglass Entry Doors</h2>
		<p>
			Fiberglass doors provide long-lasting good looks and are specifically engineered to resist denting, splitting, cracking and warping. The lock area for doors made of fiberglass is reinforced to provide a solid mounting surface for decorative hardware. And a high-performance composite material is used on the bottom rails of ProVia's fiberglass door for excellent rot resistance. The superior square-edge design and high-definition embossing on each fiberglass door create an attractive wood-door appearance.
