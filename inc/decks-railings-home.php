				<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">Composite vs. Wood <strong>Deck Construction</strong>?</h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					Wooden <strong>decks</strong> are normally made from treated lumbers: red cedar, mahogany and other hardwoods. Few aspects of a home require as much maintenance as a wood <strong>deck</strong>. Exposed to the elements, 
					a wood deck needs sanding, resealing or painting to maintain the desired look and to hold up over time. Although treated wood <strong>decks</strong> retain certain resistance properties, moisture and insects still attack, 
					and most wood decks gives in to rot over time. Any <strong>deck builder</strong> will tell you discoloration and splintering can begin after only a few months. For this reason, most people take on a regular cycle of maintenance. Failure to do so won't 
					cause your <strong>deck</strong> to rot, but your <strong>deck</strong> will most certainly become discolored and the surface will become rough and prone to splinters.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					
					The benefits of composite <strong>deck construction</strong> over wood are rot, insect, 
					and moisture resistance, and better stain hold. They do not crack or split. <strong>Deck builders</strong> prefer building composite decking because of the recycled nature of the product, these composites are more environmentally-friendly 
					than wood decking, and require less maintenance. <strong>Custom composite deck building</strong> is a great choice for people who want to enjoy their <strong>deck</strong> without all the maintenance required by wood. Low Maintenance Decking is available in 
					a wide selection of colors, profiles, and textures. Most of these products are covered by warranties to provide you with the peace of mind that your <strong>deck construction</strong> project will perform well and look great for many years.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
