				<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">When should a roof be replaced?</h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					There are many signs that your roof has outlived its life span. Missing shingles, cracked or curling shingles, Blistering or peeling paint, Damaged Flashing, your roof is rotting,  Leakage on the attic after heavy rains, Stains on interior walls or ceilings, High energy bills. Any one of these could be an indication that it is time to install a new roof.
					</p>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					Also, you should find out how long your current roof has been on your home. A roof life ranges anywhere from 15- 50 years depending on which shingle you had installed on your roof. Ask one of our roofing experts to determine the life of your roof. 
					</p>
					
					<H2 style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:1.0em;">Choose the right roof and roof color for your home.</h2>
					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					If your roof is low pitched roof, you may not have a choice in the roofing material used.  J. M. Grove Son and the manufacturers recommend that EPDM rubber roof be installed on Flat roofs. Rubber roofs are one of the most common types of low-slope roofing materials. This is because it is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and fairly clean to work with when compared to conventional built-up roofs. There aren't the odors and fumes that accompany built-up roofs which appeals to many property owners.
