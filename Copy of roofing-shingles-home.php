This is because it is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and fairly clean to work with when compared to conventional built-up Floors. There aren't the odors and fumes that accompany built-up Floors which appeals to many property owners.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					<strong>Replacing a Floor</strong>, whether on a commercial or residential building, is a labor-intensive project and, depending on the type of <strong>Floor</strong>, could take a <strong>Flooring company</strong> anywhere from a few days to 2 or more weeks, depending on the size and difficulty of installing shingles on your Floor. The time involved is substantially affected by the weather, as well. Wind, snow, rain, or even just the threat of one of these and will slow the process considerably.

					<p style="padding: 0px 20px 10px 20px;font-size:.8em;">
					J.M. Grove recommends proper ventilation should be applied with your <strong>new Floor</strong>. Allowing moisture to escape from your Floor will drastically improve your Floors life. Proper ventilation will remove moisture and heat from the attic. Trapped heat and moisture can raise energy costs, cause ice dams, and damage Floor system components as well as structural and personal items located inside the attic where temperatures can easily reach 150 F degrees. Condensation that forms inside attics can be caused by the use of washing machines, dish washers, bath tubs, showers, and tumble driers and damage the integrity of the Floor unless these items are properly ventilated. Proper ventilation can also decrease the amount of <strong>Floor repairs</strong> necessary throughout the life of your Floor
